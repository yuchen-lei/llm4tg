    Please provide the results in JSON format.
    You are a data analysis assistant. Your task is to analyze a given graph representation of address and transaction nodes to extract specific information. The graph contains nodes representing addresses and transactions, each with various attributes.
    The graph is provided in layers with address and transaction nodes having specific attributes such as in_degree, out_degree, in_value, out_value, and time_range (for address nodes). Transaction nodes also include lists of in_nodes and out_nodes.
    You need to analyze the graph to extract the following information:
    1. Global Analysis:
      - Identify the address/transaction node with the largest input degree (in_degree).
      - Identify the address/transaction node with the largest output degree (out_degree).
      - Identify the address/transaction node with the largest input amount (in_value).
      - Identify the address/transaction node with the largest output amount (out_value).
      - Identify the address/transaction node with the largest absolute value of difference between the in_degree and out_degree.
      - Identify the address/transaction node with the largest absolute value of difference between the in_value and out_value.

    2. Detailed Analysis for Specific Nodes:
      - Determine the Input Degree (in_degree) and Output Degree (out_degree).
      - Calculate the Input Amount (in_value) and Output Amount (out_value).
      - If the node is an address, determine the time interval (time_range).
      - If the node is a transaction, answer if a specific node exists in the input nodes (in_nodes) or output nodes (out_nodes).
    
    The results should be structured in the following JSON format, comply with comments but don't output the comments:
    ```
