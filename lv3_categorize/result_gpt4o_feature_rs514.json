The closeness centrality (S5) of 2.779203396112341 also suggests a complex network structure, further indicating 'exchange' or 'darknet market'. The 'blackmail' category is considered as well due to the ratio of the minimum input token amount (PAIa21-1) being 1.0 and the minimum transaction time interval (PTIa41-2) being 0.0415046296296296, which are also seen in 'blackmail' graphs."
