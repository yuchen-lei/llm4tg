(3) 'S3' value is negative and moderate, which is common in ponzi, tumbler, and exchange. (4) 'PAIa21-1' and 'PTIa41-2' values being 0 also match well with ponzi and some instances of tumbler and exchange.

Additionally, the density (S7) of 0.692 is also high, which is characteristic of Ponzi schemes. The standard deviation of in-degree (S1-2) and in-degree/out-degree (S1-6) values are moderate, similar to those found in blackmail and exchange graphs.

(2) The standard deviation of the in-degree (S1-2) is 0.2336, which is lower than average for many categories but matches well with 'blackmail', 'ponzi', and 'pool'. (3) The longest distance between any two nodes (S6) is 8, which is present in 'blackmail' and some 'ponzi' graphs. (4) The closeness centrality (S5) is 3.0659, which is relatively higher and aligns well with 'blackmail' and 'ponzi'. (5) The density (S7) is 0.3214, which overlaps with 'blackmail', 'ponzi', and 'pool'. Other characteristics such as degree correlation (S3) and the ratio of the minimum input token amount (PAIa21-1) are also considered, but the overlapping features mentioned provide a stronger basis for categorization."

Exchange and pool graphs also show similarities in these features but to a slightly lesser extent. Therefore, the top 3 possible categories are darknet market, exchange, and pool."
