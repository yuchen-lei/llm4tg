The near-zero values for PTIa41-2 and CI3a32-2, along with a PAIa21-1 of 1.0, further support these categorizations, indicating a high degree of single transaction dominance and minimal time intervals, common in these activities. S3's negative value suggests a disassortative mixing pattern, often seen in these types of networks.
