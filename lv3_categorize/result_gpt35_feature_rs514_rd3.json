The standard deviation of in-degree and out-degree (S1-6) is lower than the average of the reference graphs. The standard deviation of in-degree (S1-2) is also lower than the average. The degree correlation (S3) is negative, indicating a tendency for nodes to connect to nodes of different degrees. The graph has a high ratio of the minimum input token amount of an address node to the total input token amount of an address node (PAIa21-1), which is a common characteristic of exchange, tumbler, and pool categories. The transaction time interval of the address nodes (PTIa41-2) is 0, which is consistent with exchange and tumbler categories. The closeness centrality (S5) is close to the average of the reference graphs. The graph has a density (S7) slightly above the average, contributing to the classification into exchange, tumbler, and pool categories."
