By comparing the given graph to the reference graphs of different categories, such as blackmail, darknet market, exchange, gambling, money laundering, ponzi, pool, and tumbler, we noticed that the graph has some similarities with some of these categories, such as the number of layers, address nodes and transaction nodes, and their in_degrees and out_degrees."
