Specifically, the S2-2 (maximum out-degree) and S1-6 (standard deviation of the in-degree and out-degree) values are relatively high compared to the average of the reference graphs, which is characteristic of 'blackmail' and 'darknet market' categories. Additionally, the S5 (closeness centrality) value is somewhat high, which is more typical of 'exchange' graphs. The PAIa21-1 (ratio of the minimum input token amount of an address node to the total input token amount of an address node) is 1.0, which is common in 'blackmail' and 'darknet market' graphs, and the PTIa41-2 (minimum transaction time interval of an address node) is very low, which is also seen in some 'exchange' and 'darknet market' graphs. The CI3a32-2 (maximum value of the ratio of the change in in-degree to each transaction time interval for the address node in chronological order) is 0.0, which is common in 'blackmail' and 'darknet market' graphs. The S7 (density of graph) is moderate, which is typical for 'exchange' graphs. Overall, the combination of these features suggests that the graph is most similar to 'blackmail', 'darknet market', and 'exchange' categories."
